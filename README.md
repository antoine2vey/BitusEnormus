# mappaBot
Discord bot for several usages

## Installation
1. Invite the bot on your server with [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=198528475370356736&scope=bot&permissions=0)
2. `git clone https://github.com/antoine2vey/MappaBot.git` to clone the project
3. `npm install` or `yarn` in your project directory should do the trick!
4. `node mappaBot/app.js` to launch the bot

CARE, you must have MongoDB installed right before ([check here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/))

If you export the bot on your server, before launching the bot, you must do `export NODE_ENV=production` in your shell and change the IP of your server in the javascript file
